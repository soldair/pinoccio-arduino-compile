# Below, a number of variables are defined, that might need tweaking for
# your system.
#
# In particular, if the "arduino" command is not available
# in your system PATH, you'll need to set the ARDUINO variable to point
# to the arduino command.Note that on MacOS X, the main executable is
# Arduino.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub instead of arduino.
#
# To change these variables, you can create a file called
# build.sh.local that assigns them (that file will be included by this
# script).
